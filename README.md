Unit 6 - Natural Language Processing Project

## Introduction

Natural language processing (NLP) is used in many apps and devices to interact with users and make meaning of text to determine how to respond, find information, or to create new text. Your goal is to use natural language processing techniques to identify structure, patterns, and meaning in a text to have conversations with a user, execute commands, perform manipulations on the text, or generate new text.

## Requirements

Use your knowledge of object-oriented programming, ArrayLists, the String class, and algorithms to create a program that uses natural language processing techniques:

- **Create at least two ArrayLists** – Create at least two ArrayLists to store the data used in your program, such as data from text files or entered by the user.
- **Implement one or more algorithms** – Implement one or more algorithms that use loops and conditionals to find or manipulate elements in an ArrayList or String object.
- **Use methods in the String classs** - Use one or more methods in the String class in your program, such as to divide text into sentences or phrases.
- **Use at least one natural language processing technique** – Use a natural language processing technique to process, analyze, and/or generate text.
- **Document your code** – Use comments to explain the purpose of the methods and code segments and note any preconditions and postconditions.

## Project Description

The purpose of this project is to generate a name based on the input of the letter given by the user to the program. Using the FirstNames.txt file containing first names in alphabetical order, it compares the given letter from the user and compares it to the first letter of the names within the file. 

## NLP Techniques

I used NLP techniques in this project by using string methods. These string methods include, .equals(), toUpperCase(), and .substring(). The .equals() method is implemented to compare two string to each other, used similarly to ==, used to compare two number values. The .toUpperCase() method is implemented to correct the user input in the case that the letter inputted into the console is a lowercase letter. With this, it allows more variations of what can be compared to the first letter of each name in the txt file. The .substring() method is used to get a letter from a word at a specific index of the word.
